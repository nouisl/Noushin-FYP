## Ticket3

Ticket3 is a web-based solution that provides a secure and user-friendly ticketing experience. The platform is built using the latest web technologies, focusing on providing a seamless experience for users and ensuring transparency and security. It employs blockchain technology, cryptocurrency, and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to enhance the security, transparency, and efficiency of traditional web ticketing.
With the growing concerns around ticket fraud, the issue of limited transparency and accountability seems to be the cause. Thus, Ticket3 aims to create a secure and reliable solution to eliminate the need for third-party providers. To do so, the application utilises a smart contract that executes predetermined conditions when interacted with. The smart contract uses the ERC721 token standard to create NFTs for event tickets. Using NFTs ensures proof of authenticity and ownership, as every transaction on the blockchain is publicly visible and verifiable. This way, maximum transparency is achieved by removing any intermediary and using NFTs.
The Ticket3 platform offers various features for users. Event attendees can discover and purchase tickets. Tickets can be purchased exclusively with cryptocurrency.
